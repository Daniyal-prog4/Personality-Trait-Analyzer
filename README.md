About the Project

Personality Trait Analyzer 

The Personality Trait Analyzer is an interactive C++ program that helps users discover their MBTI-based personality type. It asks 25 simple Yes/No questions covering four major personality dimensions:

Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I)

Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N)

Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F)

Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P)

Based on the user’s responses, the program calculates trait scores and generates a four-letter personality type, such as ESTJ or INFP. It also provides a brief description of the user’s dominant traits. The program features a clean interface, user-friendly prompts, and clear results, making it a simple yet effective tool for personality assessment.
